.. admonition:: Splunk Cloud vetting

    - TrackMe is vetted for Splunk Cloud deployments
    - When a new release is published, there can be some time before the last release is vetted
    - TrackMe is developped with the higher standard of quality, it is expected that each public release can be vetted accordingly
    - Even if the latest release would not be vetted yet, open a request to Cloud Ops and the vetting process will be achieved

*Splunk Cloud notes:*

- When a new release of TrackMe is published, there is a certain amount of time required for the vetting process to be performed
- As such, in Splunk Base the current release might appear as not vetted yet
- To get TrackMe deployed in Splunk Cloud, you can submit a case to Cloud Ops, if the latest release is not vetted yet, you can request its deployment and vetting will be performed, or you can check what the latest version is in Splunk Base and request its deployment
- TrackMe currently requires an "assisted" deployment, which means that it is not currently deployable by Splunk Cloud Self Services and you need to submit a request

*Checkout the latest vetted version in Splunk Base:*

- In Splunk Base, if the latest version is not yet vetted the following message is displayed "This version is not yet available for Splunk Cloud."
- Use the version dropdown to select an earlier version to see "Splunk Cloud" listed in the Products, which confirms that this version has been vetted
